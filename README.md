This is an slightly advanved version of the childrens game rock-paper-scissors. The rules of rock-paper-scissors are as followed: rock beats scissors, paper covers rock, scissors cuts paper. Meaning there was a 1/3 chance of you winning and 1/3 chances of it being a tie.

In the expanded game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, each hand gesture has a 20% chance of winning, a 20% chance of losing, and a 20% chance of tying (if it matches the opponent's choice). With five choices, there are 25 possible outcomes, and each outcome has a 4% chance of occurring.

In simpler terms: If you pick Rock, it has a 20% chance of beating Scissors and a 20% chance of beating Lizard, and a 20% chance of a tie against Rock, as well as a 20% chance of losing to Paper and a 20% chance of losing to Spock.

The rules of the game has been placed on the screen to help remember what beats what. There's no score limit this is all about
if you are able to have more of a score then the computer and how long you can keep it that way.

The game was actually invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, who were looking for a way to expand the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. They added the two new elements – Lizard and Spock – to make the game more complex and interesting.
It was later that the game become more popular when it was shown on an episode of the popular tv show called "The Big Bang Theory"
