ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK

This is an slightly advanved version of the childrens game rock-paper-scissors. The rules of rock-paper-scissors are as followed: rock beats scissors, paper covers rock, scissors cuts paper. Meaning there was a 1/3 chance of you winning and 1/3 chances of it being a tie. With this version it goes from 1/3 chances of winning to 2/5 chances of winning and 1/5 chances of it being a tie.
