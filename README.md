This is an slightly advanved version of the childrens game rock-paper-scissors. The rules of rock-paper-scissors are as followed: rock beats scissors, paper covers rock, scissors cuts paper. Meaning there was a 1/3 chance of you winning and 1/3 chances of it being a tie.

With this version it goes from 1/3 chances of winning to 2/5 chances of winning and 1/5 chances of it being a tie.

The game was actually invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, who were looking for a way to expand the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. They added the two new elements – Lizard and Spock – to make the game more complex and interesting.
It was later that the game become more popular when it was shown on an episode of the popular tv show called "The Big Bang Theory"
